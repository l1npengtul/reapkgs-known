# reapkgs-known

Nix flake generated using [reapkgs](https://github.com/silvarc141/reapkgs) for all ReaPack indexes of repos listed as "known" on [reapack.com](https://reapack.com/repos.txt).  
Since regeneration is automated, the flake provides no additional vetting of packages, beside the fact they are from "known" indexes.
